# Project Description:
 - The Library Management System is a website built using the Django Framework to manage small libraries. 
 - The website allows users to easily manage the books available in the library, books for rent and books that have been sold. 
 - The system also provides the ability to calculate profits from books and display statistics for these books.

 ## The main features of the Library Management System include:
 - Storing information about books available in the library, books for rent, and books that have been sold
 - Calculating profits from books and displaying statistics for these books.
 - Adding and modifying book data or adding new categories
 - Searching for books by name
 
## The website consists of four pages:
 1. Homepage: This page provides an overview of the library and its books.
 2. All Books page: This page contains a list of all books available in the library.
 3. Edit Book Information page: This page allows users to edit information about a specific book.
 4. Book Delete page: This page allows users to delete a book from the library.
